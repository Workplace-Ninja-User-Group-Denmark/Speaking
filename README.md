# Workplace Ninjas User Group Denmark – Speaker Info

Welcome, and thanks for speaking at **Workplace Ninjas User Group Denmark (WPNinjasDK)**.

This repository contains practical speaker information and a template you can use to share everything we need (bio, session details, links, etc.).

## Event Format (Important)

- **All meetings are online (Microsoft Teams).**
- **Meeting cadence:** **2nd Friday of every month** (with a few exceptions, because of holidays etc.)
- You should already have received the **Teams meeting invite** that covers the full event.
  - If you **did not** receive the Teams invite, please reach out to the organizers so we can forward it.

## Speaker Expectations

### Be online early
- Please join the Teams meeting **at least 10-15 minutes before your session**.
- This gives us time for a quick sound/video check and a smooth handover from the previous speaker.
