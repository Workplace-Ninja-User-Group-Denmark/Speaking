# Workplace Ninjas User Group Denmark – Speaker Info

Welcome, and thanks for speaking at **Workplace Ninjas User Group Denmark (WPNinjasDK)**.

This repository contains practical speaker information and a template you can use when delivering your session with us.



## Event Format (Important)

- **All meetings are online (Microsoft Teams).**
- **Meeting cadence:** **2nd Friday of every month** (with a few exceptions, because of holidays etc.)
- You should already have received the **Teams meeting invite** that covers the full event.
  - If you **did not** receive the Teams invite, please reach out to the organizers so we can forward it.

## Speaker Expectations

### Be online early
- Please join the Teams meeting **at least 10-15 minutes before your session**.
- This gives us time for a quick sound/video check and a smooth handover from the previous speaker.

### Audio & video recommendations
- Use a **headset** (or a decent microphone) to avoid echo.
- If possible, use a **stable wired connection** (or strong Wi-Fi).
- Close heavy apps and avoid background downloads right before your session.

### Screen sharing
- Use **Share screen** and select the specific window (slides / demo window) when possible.
- If you demo anything, have it open and ready before you go live.
- Consider increasing font size for demos so it’s readable for attendees.

### Timekeeping
- Keep an eye on time and aim to leave space for **Q&A** (if applicable).
- If you want us to help with time signals, tell us and we’ll do it via chat.
